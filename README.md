# Virtuous Interview

## Covering Donation Costs

In this exercise we will be using VS Code in Codespaces on Github. Please login to Github and open this Repository by clicking *Code* (Green Button) then clicking the Tab *Codespaces* and finally clicking *Create codespace on trunk*.

In src/Program.cs we would like you to implement the following formula: ![Cover costs function](resources/StripeCostsFormula.jpeg).

Here is an example of what we are trying to achieve:

- Bob donates $100, Bob is great.
- With Credit card processing there are always two parts to charging a card, percentage and fixed fee.
- We will use 2.9% percentage fee + 30 cents fixed fee.
- The donation will end up only being $96.70 after fees.
- Bob would like to cover the costs!
- The formula above will allow the nonprofit to recieve the full $100.

What is the final donation Bob will make after covering costs?

## Run and Test

When you are ready to compile and test your solution open the terminal and type:

```bash
cd src
dotnet run
```
