# Virtuous Example

In this exercise we will be using VS Code in Codespaces on Github. Please login to Github and open this Repository by clicking Code (Green Button) then clicking the Tab Codespaces and finally clicking 'Create codespace on trunk'.

In Program.cs we would like you to implement the following formula: ![Cover costs function](https://github.com/brainded/VirtuousExample/blob/trunk/resources/StripeCostsFormula.jpeg).

Here is an example of what we are trying to achieve:

Bob donates $100, Bob is great.
With Credit card processing there are always two parts to charging a card, the percenate and flat fees. Normally we see around 2.9% and 30 cents.
In this example we will be using 3% and 30 cents.
The donation will end up only being $96.70 after fees.
Bob would like to cover the costs!
The formula above will allow the nonprofit to recieve the full $100.
What is the final donation Bob will make after covering costs?
